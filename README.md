# multicombinationalcircuit
A combinational logic circuit is one in which the present state of the combination of the logic  inputs decides the output. The term combination logic means combining of two or more logic gates  to form a required function where the output at a given time depends only on the input. This project  describes the design and working of a MULTI-COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT using Verilog  HDL. Our project aims to design a program where the user can select two combinational circuits  of his choice, based on the user input the program will execute. 
Example: Encoder, Decoder, Mux, De-Mux, Adder. 
Different types of combinational logic circuits are used for various applications. Depending on the  function of the logic circuit employed for, combinational logic circuits are mainly classified into  three types, namely Arithmetic and logic circuits, data transmission circuits and code converter  circuits. For minimizing Boolean expressions, various simplification techniques are available so  that they reduce the number of gates, hence less implementation cost. 
<b>Methodology</b> 
Identification and determination of number of available input variables and required output  variables. Representing symbols (alphabets) for each and every input and output variables. Expressing the input and output variable’s relationship. Construction of truth table indicating  the relationship between the input and output variables. Obtaining the Boolean expression each  output variable in terms of input variables. Minimizing the Boolean expressions of various  output variables. Obtaining the logic diagram by the implementation of minimized Boolean  expressions.
The output of combinational circuit at any instant of time, depends only on the levels present  at input terminals. The combinational circuit do not use any memory. The previous state of  input does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit. A combinational circuit can  have an n number of inputs and m number of outputs.
